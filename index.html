<p>Welcome to our project page!</p>

<a id="who-is-a-nurse-practitioner" class="anchor" href="#who-is-a-nurse-practitioner" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who is a Nurse Practitioner?</h3>

<p>A Nurse Practitioner is a nurse who has received specialized education beyond the requirements for a basic nursing license. NPs can specialize in a variety of areas, which include oncology, cardiology, family health and women’s health to mention a few. NPs are able to independently consult with patients, order tests, prescribe medication, diagnose and treat conditions as outlined in their scope of practice.</p>

<p>Adopting the Nurse Practitioner model in Nigeria will dramatically increase the number of skilled health professionals who are able to contribute to the management of our growing health care needs. This proposal will focus on the adaptation of this model to increase the number of competent practitioners that will specialize in Women’s health and General Family Practice.</p>

<a id="how-do-we-plan-to-implement-this-model" class="anchor" href="#how-do-we-plan-to-implement-this-model" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do we plan to implement this model?</h3>

<p>For this approach to succeed we will need extensive planning and strategy development. The first step will be to identify key personnel within the Nigerian educational system, Nigerian hospitals and in potential collaborator programs in the US that will work together with us to model this system and adapt it to the Nigerian health care system as we currently know it. The next step will be the incorporation of modern technology that will facilitate distance learning, information sharing and student-instructor communication within and outside the country. With adequate planning and the backing of the Nigerian government we can implement this strategy within a year and minimize the risk of failure. </p>
